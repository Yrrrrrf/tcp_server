# Rust TCP Server Code Documentation

## Overview
This Rust module defines a TCP server capable of handling multiple connections using threads. The server is designed to parse HTTP requests, generate appropriate responses, and support basic routing and file serving. It utilizes a thread pool for handling incoming connections concurrently.

### Features
- TCP server with a thread pool for handling concurrent connections.
- Parses HTTP requests and generates responses.
- Supports basic routing and file serving.

## Usage
To use the server, call the `main` function. The server reads its configuration from the `resources/keys/keys.toml` file, including IP address and port.

### Dependencies
This module relies on external crates for various utilities:
- `log`: A flexible logging framework for Rust.
- `dev_utils`: A set of utility functions for development purposes.

## Important Notes
- The server responds to HTTP GET requests, handling basic routing.
- The server serves a default "200 OK" response for every request.
- The server may exit after handling a specific number of requests (configured in the code).
- Logging is configured with varying levels from `Trace` to `Info.

## Module Structure

### Module Imports
The module imports various components from the standard library, external crates (`log`, `dev_utils`), and an internal module (`thread_pool`).

### Main Function
The `main` function initializes the server, reads configuration data, and starts listening for incoming connections using a thread pool.

### Handling Client Connections
The `handle_client` function manages individual client connections by reading requests, checking for favicon requests, and generating responses. It uses a buffer to read data from the stream and distinguishes favicon requests to avoid unnecessary processing.

### Request Line Matching
The `match_request_line` function parses the components of an HTTP request line, including the HTTP method, URL, and HTTP version. It returns an `Option` containing the parsed components.

### Handling Methods and URLs
The `match_method_and_url` function matches the request method and URL to perform appropriate CRUD operations. It interacts with the `crud` module for file creation, reading, updating, and deletion.

### Handling Services
The `handle_service` function implements basic routing based on the provided URL, generating custom responses for specific routes.

### Generating Responses
The `generate_response` function creates an HTTP response for a given message and status code. It reads an HTML file, replaces placeholders, and constructs an `HttpResponse` with the modified content.

## Conclusion
This Rust TCP server module provides a foundation for building a simple yet flexible server capable of handling concurrent connections, parsing HTTP requests, and generating responses with basic routing and file serving capabilities.
